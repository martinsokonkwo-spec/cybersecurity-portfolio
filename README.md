# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Martins Okonkwo

This repository showcases an end-to-end SOC → GRC cybersecurity portfolio, demonstrating practical skills in incident detection, analysis, response, risk assessment, and post-incident review. The projects reflect real-world security operations and governance workflows aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and industry best practices.

## Portfolio Focus
- Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis
- Incident detection, triage, and response
- Log analysis and indicator of compromise (IOC) identification
- Risk assessment and control mapping
- Post-incident review and continuous improvement
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) fundamentals

## Projects Overview

### 1. SOC Alert Triage & Incident Reporting
- Triage security alerts and document incidents
- Analyze alert context, impact, and response actions
- Produce structured incident reports suitable for SOC environments

### 2. Log Analysis & IOC Identification
- Analyze system and security logs
- Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Correlate events to detect suspicious or malicious activity

### 3. Incident Response Playbook (NIST SP 800-61)
- Develop an incident response playbook aligned with NIST SP 800-61
- Define roles, responsibilities, and response phases
- Support consistent and effective incident handling

### 4. Risk Assessment & Control Mapping
- Perform risk assessment based on a phishing and credential compromise scenario
- Evaluate impact and likelihood
- Identify inherent and residual risk
- Map security controls to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

### 5. Post-Incident Risk Review
- Conduct a post-incident review following a phishing-related security incident
- Analyze root causes and control effectiveness
- Document lessons learned and actionable recommendations
- Support continuous improvement of security posture

## Frameworks & Standards Referenced
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- NIST SP 800-61 (Incident Response Lifecycle)
- Risk management and GRC best practices

## Purpose
This portfolio demonstrates applied cybersecurity skills beyond certifications, highlighting analytical thinking, structured documentation, and the ability to bridge SOC operations with GRC risk management.
